The ooze can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that restore a creature's hp maximum. The ooze retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma and condition immunities. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies."
