The storm imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks based on sight or hearing within the area. The winds extinguish open flames and disperse fog.

Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) lightning damage. The storm's area is difficult terrain for any creature other than the slow storm."
