If the cloaker has advantage on the attack roll, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can't make Bite attacks, and at the start of each of the cloaker's turns, the target takes 18 (4d6+4) piercing damage. The attached cloaker moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the cloaker's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 15 STR check."
