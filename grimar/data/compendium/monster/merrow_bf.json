While the harpoon is stuck, the merrow can't make Harpoon attacks against other targets, and the target and merrow can't move farther than 60 feet away from each other. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the harpoon by succeeding on a DC 14 STR check. Alternatively, the cord connecting the merrow to the harpoon can be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; HP 15; immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage), dislodging the harpoon into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target and preventing the merrow from using Recall Harpoon."
