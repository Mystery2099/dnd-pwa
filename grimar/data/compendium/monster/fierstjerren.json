The charmed target can't take reactions and obeys the fierstjerren's verbal and telepathic commands. A fierstjerren can have up to twelve charmed thralls at one time. A charmed thrall loses the memories of its previous life and devotes itself to the fierstjerren and the cult. The charm lasts for 24 hours or until the fierstjerren is destroyed, is more than 300 feet from the charmed target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. The fierstjerren can attempt to reassert control over all of its thralls by using this action. Each thrall can repeat the saving throw when the fierstjerren uses this action to reassert control."
