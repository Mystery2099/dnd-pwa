If a creature poisoned by the mbielu's Toxic Skin fails this saving throw, it is also incapacitated until the end of its next turn as the combined vibrations and hallucinations disorient it."

The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
