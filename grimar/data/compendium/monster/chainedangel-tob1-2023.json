If the spellcaster survives, the chained angel must immediately make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the angel's chains fall away. It is restored to its senses and the form it had before it was chained, typically a deva. On a failure, the chained angel remains chained for 7 days, and during that time, any further attempts to cast knock on the angel's chains fail."
