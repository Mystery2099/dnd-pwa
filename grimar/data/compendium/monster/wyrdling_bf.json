The creature must ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. At the end of the minute, the wyrdling pronounces the result of the target's inquiry. This trait works like the divination spell, except it can't be used to answer a specific creature's question more than once every 3 days, regardless if the creature asks a different question."
