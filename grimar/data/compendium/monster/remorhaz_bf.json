If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 DEX save or be swallowed by the remorhaz. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns. If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 19 CON save at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."
