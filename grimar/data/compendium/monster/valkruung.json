Each tendril can pick up or hold a Tiny object, such as a coin or piece of jewelry, that isn't being worn or carried. If it uses all 10 of its tendrils, the valkruung can carry a single Small object, such as a backpack. The valkruung can use its tendrils to interact with objects, but it can't use them to wield a weapon. It has advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks when using its tendrils and can use its tendrils to disarm opponents (see the Disarming Tendrils reaction)."
