This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened. A frightened creature can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
