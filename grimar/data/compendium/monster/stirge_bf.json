While attached, the stirge can't attack, and at the start of each of the stirge's turns, the target loses 4 (1d4+2) HP due to blood loss. The attached stirge moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the stirge's movement. If can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. It does so after it drains 8 HP of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the stirge."
