The charmed target obeys the maiden's verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm from the maiden or her allies, or if it receives a suicidal command, it can make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. The maiden can have no more than three Humanoids charmed at a time."

The area then becomes icy, difficult terrain for 1 minute."
