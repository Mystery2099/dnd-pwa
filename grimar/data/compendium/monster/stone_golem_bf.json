On a failure, a creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
