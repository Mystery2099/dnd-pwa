The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the frog, and it takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the frog's turns. The frog can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the frog takes any damage from the swallowed creature, the frog must succeed on a DC 11 CON save at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the frog. If the frog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone."
