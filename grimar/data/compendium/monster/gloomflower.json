On a failure, a creature is bombarded with visions of its fears and anxieties for 1 minute. While bombarded, it takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns and must spend its action to make one melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it, other than the gloomflower or itself. If the creature can't make a melee attack, it takes the Dodge action. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a success, a creature is incapacitated by hallucinations until the end of its next turn but isn't bombarded with visions of its fears and anxieties. \n\nA creature that is reduced to 0 hp by this psychic damage falls unconscious and is stable. When that creature regains consciousness, it suffers permanent hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks until cured by a remove curse spell or similar magic."
