On a failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) acid damage, its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the acid damage it takes, and it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0."
