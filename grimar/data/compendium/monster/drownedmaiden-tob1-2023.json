This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its Strength is reduced to 0."

The illusion ends if the maiden takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the maiden is disguised."
