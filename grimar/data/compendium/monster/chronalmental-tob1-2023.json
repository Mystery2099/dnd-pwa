Then, the chronalmental's position in the initiative order increases by 10, its speed increases by 30 feet, and when it takes the Multiattack action, it can make one additional Slam attack.

The creature disappears for the duration, returning to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space, when the effect ends.
