The storm is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder centered on the silhouette and moves with the silhouette for 1 minute, until it ends the storm as a bonus action, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The sandstorm's area is lightly obscured, and a creature that starts its turn in the sandstorm's area or enters it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and be frightened for 1 minute. An engulfed creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
