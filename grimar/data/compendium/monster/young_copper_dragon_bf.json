While the dragon's Acid Breath is available, any weapon made of metal that hits the dragon corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If a nonmagical weapon's penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the dragon is destroyed after dealing damage. A magical weapon can't have a penalty greater than -5, and a magical weapon removes this penalty after 24 hours or after its attuned wielder finishes a long rest."
