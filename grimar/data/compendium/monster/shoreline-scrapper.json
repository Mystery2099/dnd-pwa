If the item is a weapon and the wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is adhered to the shell and is restrained. A stuck item can't be used. A creature can take its action to remove one creature or object from the shoreline scrapper's shell by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. \n\nItems made of gold and silver are unaffected by the shoreline scrapper's Magnetic Shell.
