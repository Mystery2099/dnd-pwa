The area is difficult terrain for 1 min. Each creature in the cylinder must make a DC 16 Dex save. On a failure a creature takes 24 (7d6) fire and is coated in hardened lava. On a success a creature takes half the damage and isn't coated in hardened lava. A creature coated in hardened lava has its speed halved while it remains coated. A creature including the coated creature can take its action to break and remove the hardened lava ending the effect."
