The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.\n\nThe harpy can use an action to end the song and cast mass suggestion. Each creature that can hear the harpy's song must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the spell for 8 hours. If the harpy chooses to end the song this way, it can't use Guiding Song again until it finishes a long rest."
