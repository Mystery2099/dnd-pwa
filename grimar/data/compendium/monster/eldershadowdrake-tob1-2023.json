The ball bursts into a 20-foot-radius sphere of black mist centered on that point for 1 minute. Each creature in the mist when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The mist spreads around corners, and its area is magical darkness. No natural light can illuminate the mist. If any of the mist overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 1st level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled."
