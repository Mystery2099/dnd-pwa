A charmed target doesn't have to obey the ambassador's commands, but it views the ambassador's words in the most favorable way. \n\nEach time a charmed target witnesses the shadow fey ambassador or its allies do something harmful to the target or its companions, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts as long as the ambassador maintains concentration, up to 8 hours."
