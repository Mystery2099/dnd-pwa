Each creature within 30 feet of the ghillie dubh must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become hopelessly lost in the ghillie dubh's forest. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks and takes 50 percent more time on overland travel, even delaying clearheaded companions. \n* Share Knowledge. Each creature within 30 feet of the ghillie dubh has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks. The creature can move at a fast pace through forest terrain, and difficult terrain composed of nonmagical plants doesn't cost it extra movement."
