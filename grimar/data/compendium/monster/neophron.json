A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neophron, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neophron's turns. \n\nThe neophron can only swallow one creature at a time. If a humanoid dies while swallowed, it transforms into a ghast. At the start of its next turn, the neophron regurgitates the ghast into an unoccupied space within 10 feet. The ghast is under the neophron's control and acts immediately after the neophron in the initiative count. \n\nIf the neophron takes 20 or more damage in a single turn from a creature inside it, the neophron must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the neophron. If the neophron dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.",
