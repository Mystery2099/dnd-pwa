When a creature ends a fall in the cube, it takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d10. A creature that enters the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained. On a success, the creature's speed is halved as long as it remains in the cube. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The cube lasts until the start of the dragon's next turn."
