On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour or until it spends 10 minutes washing off the musk. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. While a creature is poisoned in this way, any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the poisoned creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn."
