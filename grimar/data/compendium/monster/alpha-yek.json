On a failure, a piece of the bone breaks and sticks in the target's wound. The target takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns as long as the bone remains lodged in its wound. A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove the bone by succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The bone also falls out of the wound if the target receives magical healing \n\nA yek typically carries 3 (1d6) bone shards, which are destroyed on a successful hit. It can use its action to tear a bone shard from a corpse within 5 feet. Derro",
