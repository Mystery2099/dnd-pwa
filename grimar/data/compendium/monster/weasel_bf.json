Instead of dealing damage, the weasel can steal one item the target is wearing or carrying, provided the item weighs no more than 5 pounds, can fit in one hand, isn't a weapon, and isn't wrapped around or firmly attached to the target. For example, a weasel could steal a hat or belt pouch but not a creature's shirt or armor."
