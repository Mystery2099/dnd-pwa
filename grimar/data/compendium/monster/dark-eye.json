On a failure, the creature takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the dark eye until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dark eye in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
