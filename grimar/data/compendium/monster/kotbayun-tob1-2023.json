The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the kot bayun uses a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing, the target has disadvantage on this saving throw. Otherwise, the effect ends for a target if the target takes damage while below half its hp maximum."
