It can have up to 5 such traits at a time, no more than two of which can be attacks. Each trait lasts until the xenabsorber replaces it with another trait as a bonus action. If the xenabsorber goes a week without exposure to a single beast or humanoid, it loses all of its traits and reverts back to its true, blue crystalline form."
