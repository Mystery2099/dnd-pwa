The egg hatches after 30 days, and the larval tosculi bursts out of the host, killing the host in the process. A creature can take its action to remove the egg by succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Alternatively, a spell or effect that cures disease disintegrates the unhatched tosculi."
