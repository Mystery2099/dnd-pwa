Until the disease is cured, the target is poisoned. Every 24 hours that elapse, the infected creature must repeat the save, reducing its HP maximum by 5 (2d4) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its HP maximum to 0."
