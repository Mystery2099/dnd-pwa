  "desc": "Upon casting this spell, one type of plant within range gains the ability to puff a cloud of pollen based on conditions you supply during casting. If the conditions are met, an affected plant sprays a pollen cloud in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of a poisoned creature's turn, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, it is no longer poisoned. A plant can only release this pollen once within the duration.",
