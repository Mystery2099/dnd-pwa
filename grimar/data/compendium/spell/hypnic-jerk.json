  "desc": "Strange things happen in the mind and body in that moment between waking and sleeping. One of the most common is being startled awake by a sudden feeling of falling. With a snap of your fingers, you trigger that sensation in a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it drops one object it is holding. A dropped object lands in the creature's space.",
