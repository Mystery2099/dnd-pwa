  "desc": "You touch a willing creature or object that is not being worn or carried. For the duration, the target gives off no odor. A creature that relies on smell has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the target and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target. The target is invisible to a creature that relies solely on smell to sense its surroundings. This spell has no effect on targets with unusually strong scents, such as ghasts.",
