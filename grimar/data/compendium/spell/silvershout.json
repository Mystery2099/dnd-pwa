  "desc": "You unleash a shout that coats all creatures in a 30'foot cone in silver dust. If a creature in that area is a shapeshifter, the dust covering it glows. In addition, each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, weapon attacks against that creature are considered to be silvered for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered for 1 minute.",
