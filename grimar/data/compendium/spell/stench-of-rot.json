  "desc": "Choose one creature you can see within range that isn’t a construct or an undead. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. While cursed, the target reeks of death and rot, and nothing short of magic can mask or remove the smell. The target has disadvantage on all Charisma checks and on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells. A creature with the Keen Smell trait, or a similar trait indicating the creature has a strong sense of smell, can add your spellcasting ability modifier to its Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks to find the target. A [remove curse](https://api.open5e.com/spells/remove-curse) spell or similar magic ends the spell early.\n",
