  "desc": "You cause a creature's lungs to fill with seawater. Unless the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, it immediately begins suffocating. A suffocating creature can’t speak or perform verbal spell components. It can hold its breath, and thereafter can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round), after which it drops to 0 hit points and is dying. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected, as are creatures that can breathe water or that don’t require air.\n\nA suffocating (not dying) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.\n",
  "higher_level": "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nNOTE: Midgard Heroes Handbook has a very different [drown-heroes-handbook/drown](https://api.open5e.com/spells/drown) spell.",
