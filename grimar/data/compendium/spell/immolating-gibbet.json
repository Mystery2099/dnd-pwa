  "desc": "You cause up to three creatures you can see within range to be yanked into the air where their blood turns to fire, burning them from within. Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically pulled up to 60 into the air. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends. A restrained creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. The creature takes 7d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n  At the end of each of its turns, a restrained creature can make another Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the creature, and the creature falls to the ground, taking falling damage as normal. Alternatively, the restrained creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends, and the creature falls to the ground, taking falling damage as normal.",
