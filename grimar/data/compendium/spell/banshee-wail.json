  "desc": "You emit a soul-shattering wail. Every creature within a 30-foot cone who hears the wail must make a Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail take 6d10 psychic damage and become frightened of you; a frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. Those that succeed take 3d10 psychic damage and aren't frightened. This spell has no effect on constructs and undead.",
