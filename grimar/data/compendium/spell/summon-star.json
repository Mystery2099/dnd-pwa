  "desc": "You summon a friendly star from the heavens to do your bidding. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range and takes the form of a glowing humanoid with long white hair. All creatures other than you who view the star must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for the duration of the spell. A creature charmed in this way can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer charmed and is immune to the effect of this casting of the spell. In all other ways, the star is equivalent to a [deva](https://api.open5e.com/monsters/deva). It understands and obeys verbal commands you give it. If you do not give the star a command, it defends itself and attacks the last creature that attacked it. The star disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.",
