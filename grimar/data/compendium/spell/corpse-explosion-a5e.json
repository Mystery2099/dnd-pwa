  "desc": "A corpse explodes in a poisonous cloud. Each creature in a 10-foot radius of the corpse must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 thunder damage and is poisoned for 1 minute on a failed save, or it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned on a successful one. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success.",
