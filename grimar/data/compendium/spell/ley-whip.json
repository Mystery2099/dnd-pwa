  "desc": "You channel the power of a ley line within 1 mile into a crackling tendril of multicolored ley energy. The tendril extends from your hand but doesn't interfere with your ability to hold or manipulate objects. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can direct the tendril to strike a target within 50 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack; on a hit, the tendril does 3d8 force damage and the target must make a Strength saving throw. If the saving throw fails, you can push the target away or pull it closer, up to 10 feet in either direction. Special. A geomancer with a bound ley line can cast this spell as long as he or she is on the same plane as the bound line.",
