  "desc": "By touching a target, you gain one sense, movement type and speed, feat, language, immunity, or extraordinary ability of the target for the duration of the spell. The target also retains the use of the borrowed ability. An unwilling target prevents the effect with a successful Constitution saving throw. The target can be a living creature or one that's been dead no longer than 1 minute; a corpse makes no saving throw. You can possess only one borrowed power at a time.",
  "higher_level": "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level, its duration increases to 1 hour. Additionally, the target loses the stolen power for the duration of the spell.",
