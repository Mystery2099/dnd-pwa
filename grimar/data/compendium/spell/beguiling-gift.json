If the person you hand it to accepts it willingly, they must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or use the object as it's meant to be used at their first opportunity: writing with a pen, consuming food or drink, wearing clothing, drawing a weapon, etc. After the first use, they're under no compulsion to continue using the object or even to keep it.",
