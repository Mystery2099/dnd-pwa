  "desc": "A small icy globe shoots from your finger to a point within range and then explodes in a spray of ice. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or become coated in ice for 1 minute. Ice-coated creatures move at half speed. An invisible creature becomes outlined by the ice so that it loses the benefits of invisibility while the ice remains. The spell ends for a specific creature if that creature takes 5 or more fire damage.",
