  "desc": "You create a zone that minimizes deception. Any creature that is able to be charmed can't speak a deliberate lie while in the area.\n\nAn affected creature is aware of the spell and can choose not to speak, or it might be evasive in its communications. A creature that enters the zone for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d4 psychic damage when it intentionally tries to mislead or occlude important information. Each time the spell damages a creature, it makes a Deception check (DC 8 + the damage dealt) or its suffering is obvious. You know whether a creature succeeds on its saving throw",
