  "name": "Blood to Acid",
  "desc": "When you cast this spell, you designate a creature within range and convert its blood into virulent acid. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10d12 acid damage and is stunned by the pain for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.\n\nCreatures without blood, such as constructs and plants, are not affected by this spell. If **blood to acid** is cast on a creature composed mainly of blood, such as a [blood elemental](https://api.open5e.com/monsters/blood-elemental) or a [blood zombie](https://api.open5e.com/monsters/blood-zombie), the creature is slain by the spell if its saving throw fails.",
