  "desc": "You call upon night to arrive ahead of schedule. With a sharp word, you create a 30-foot-radius cylinder of night centered on a point on the ground within range. The cylinder extends vertically for 100 feet or until it reaches an obstruction, such as a ceiling. The area inside the cylinder is normal darkness, and thus heavily obscured. Creatures inside the darkened cylinder can see illuminated areas outside the cylinder normally.",
