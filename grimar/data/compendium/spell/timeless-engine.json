  "desc": "Deep Magic: clockwork You halt the normal processes of degradation and wear in a nonmagical clockwork device, making normal maintenance unnecessary and slowing fuel consumption to 1/10th of normal. For magical devices and constructs, the spell greatly reduces wear. A magical clockwork device, machine, or creature that normally needs daily maintenance only needs care once a year; if it previously needed monthly maintenance, it now requires attention only once a decade.",
