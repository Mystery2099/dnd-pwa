  "desc": "When you cast this spell, a creature you designate within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bleed from its nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. This bleeding deals no damage but imposes a –2 penalty on the creature’s Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom checks. **Blood tide** has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nA bleeding creature might attract the attention of creatures such as stirges, sharks, or giant mosquitoes, depending on the circumstances.\n\nA [cure wounds](https://api.open5e.com/spells/cure-wounds) spell stops the bleeding before the duration of blood tide expires, as does a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.",
