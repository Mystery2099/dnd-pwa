  "desc": "This spell allows a creature within range to quickly perform a simple task (other than attacking or casting a spell) as a bonus action on its turn. Examples include finding an item in a backpack, drinking a potion, and pulling a rope. Other actions may also fall into this category, depending on the GM's ruling. The target also ignores the loading property of weapons.",
