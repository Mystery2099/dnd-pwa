  "desc": "You call upon the secret lore of beasts and gain the ability to speak with them. Beasts have a different perspective of the world, and their knowledge and awareness is filtered through that perspective. At a minimum, beasts can tell you about nearby locations and monsters, including things they have recently perceived. At the Narrator's discretion, you might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you.",
