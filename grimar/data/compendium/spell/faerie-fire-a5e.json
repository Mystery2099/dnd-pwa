Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined unless it makes a Dexterity saving throw. Until the spell ends, affected objects and creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.\n\nAny attack roll against an affected object or creature has advantage. The spell also negates the benefits of invisibility on affected creatures and objects.",
