  "desc": "You surround yourself with the forces of chaos. Wild lights and strange sounds engulf you, making stealth impossible. While **wild shield** is active, you can use a reaction to repel a spell of 4th level or lower that targets you or whose area you are within. A repelled spell has no effect on you, but doing this causes the chance of a chaos magic surge as if you had cast a spell, with you considered the caster for any effect of the surge.\n\n**Wild shield** ends when the duration expires or when it absorbs 4 levels of spells. If you try to repel a spell whose level exceeds the number of levels remaining, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level – the number of levels **wild shield** can still repel. If the check succeeds, the spell is repelled; if the check fails, the spell has its full effect. The chance of a chaos magic surge exists regardless of whether the spell is repelled.\n",
