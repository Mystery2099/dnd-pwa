For the duration, any creature within 10 feet of you and able to see you can’t willingly move closer to you unless it makes a successful Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.\n\nFor the duration of the spell, you also gain vulnerability to radiant damage and have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the frightened condition.",
