If the attacker is a fiend or undead, it takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. The creature then must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make another Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it is no longer stunned.",
