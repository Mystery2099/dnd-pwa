  "desc": "This spell targets one enemy, which must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, an illusory ally of yours appears in a space from which it threatens to make a melee attack against the target. Your allies gain advantage on melee attacks against the target for the duration because of the distracting effect of the illusion. An affected target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n",
