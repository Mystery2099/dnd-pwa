  "desc": "One end of the target rope rises into the air until it hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end, a nearly imperceptible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that can fit up to 8 Medium or smaller creatures. The entrance can be reached by climbing the rope. Once inside, the rope can be pulled into the extradimensional space.\n\nNo spells or attacks can cross into or out of the extradimensional space. Creatures inside the extradimensional space can see out of a 3-foot-by- 5-foot window centered on its entrance. Creatures outside the space can spot the entrance with a Perception check against your spell save DC. If they can reach it, creatures can pass in and out of the space.\n\nWhen the spell ends, anything inside the extradimensional space falls to the ground.",
