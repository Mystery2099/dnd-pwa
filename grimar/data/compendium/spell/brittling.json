  "desc": "This spell uses biting cold to make a metal or stone object you touch become brittle and more easily shattered. The object’s hit points are reduced by a number equal to your level as a spellcaster, and Strength checks to shatter or break the object are made with advantage if they occur within 1 minute of the spell’s casting. If the object isn’t shattered during this time, it reverts to the state it was in before the spell was cast.",
