  "desc": "Your muscles swell with arcane power. They're too clumsy to effectively wield weapons but certainly strong enough for a powerful punch. Until the spell ends, you can choose to use your spellcasting ability score for Athletics checks, and for the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.",
