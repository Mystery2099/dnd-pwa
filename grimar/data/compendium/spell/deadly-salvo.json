  "desc": "When you cast this spell, the ammunition flies from your hand with a loud bang, targeting up to five creatures or objects you can see within range. You can launch the bullets at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each bullet. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 piercing damage. This damage can experience a burst, as described in the gunpowder weapon property (see the Adventuring Gear chapter), but this spell counts as a single effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can burst, regardless of the number of targets affected.",
