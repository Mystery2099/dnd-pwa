  "desc": "You cause a thick carpet of vines to grow from a point on the ground within range. The vines cover objects and prone creatures within 20 feet of that point. While covered in this way, objects and creatures have total cover as long as they remain motionless. A creature that moves while beneath the carpet has only three-quarters cover from attacks on the other side of the carpet. A covered creature that stands up from prone stands atop the carpet and is no longer covered. The carpet of vines is plush enough that a Large or smaller creature can walk across it without harming or detecting those covered by it.\n  When the spell ends, the vines wither away into nothingness, revealing any objects and creatures that were still covered.",
