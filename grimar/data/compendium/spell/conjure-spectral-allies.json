  "desc": "You sprinkle some graveyard dirt before you and call forth vengeful spirits. The spirits erupt from the ground at a point you choose within range and sweep outward. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 necrotic damage and becomes frightened for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened.\n  At the end of each of its turns, a creature frightened by this spell can make another saving throw. On a success, this spell ends on the creature.",
