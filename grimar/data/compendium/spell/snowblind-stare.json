  "desc": "Your eyes burn with a bright, cold light that inflicts snow blindness on a creature you target within 30 feet of you. If the target fails a Constitution saving throw, it suffers the first stage of snow blindness (see [Conditions](https://api.open5e.com/sections/conditions)), or the second stage of snow blindness if it already has the first stage. The target recovers as described in [Conditions](https://api.open5e.com/sections/conditions).",
