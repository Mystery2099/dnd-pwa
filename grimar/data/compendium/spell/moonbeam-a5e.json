  "desc": "A beam of moonlight fills the area with dim light.\n\nWhen a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn in the area, it is struck by silver flames and makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.\n\nShapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while within the spell's light.\n\nOn your turn, you may use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.",
