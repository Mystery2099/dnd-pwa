  "desc": "Using your strength of will, you cause one creature other than yourself that you touch to become so firmly entrenched within reality that it is protected from the effects of a chaos magic surge. The protected creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally allowed. Once the protected creature makes a successful saving throw allowed by **surge dampener**, the spell ends.",
