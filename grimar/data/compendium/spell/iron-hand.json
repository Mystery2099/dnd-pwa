  "name": "Iron Hand",
  "desc": "**Iron hand** is a common spell among metalsmiths and other crafters who work with heat. When you use this spell, one of your arms becomes immune to fire damage, allowing you to grasp red-hot metal, scoop up molten glass with your fingers, or reach deep into a roaring fire to pick up an object. In addition, if you take the Dodge action while you’re protected by **iron hand**, you have resistance to fire damage until the start of your next turn.",
