  "desc": "Constraining plants erupt from the ground in the spell's area, wrapping vines and tendrils around creatures. Until the spell ends, the area is difficult terrain.\n\nA creature in the area when you cast the spell makes a Strength saving throw or it becomes restrained as the plants wrap around it. A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.\n\nWhen the spell ends, the plants wither away.",
