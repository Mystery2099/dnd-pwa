  "desc": "Provided the target's soul is willing and able to return to its body, it returns to life with all of its hit points.\n\nThe spell cures any poisons and diseases that affected the target at the time of death, closes all mortal wounds, and restores any missing body parts.\n\nIf no body (or body parts) exist, you can still cast the spell but must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you. This option requires diamonds worth at least 50, 000 gold (consumed by the spell).",
