  "desc": "You loose a growl from deep within the pit of your stomach, causing others who can hear it to become unnerved. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks you make before the beginning of your next turn. In addition, each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of your turn. You are aware of which creatures failed their saving throws.",
