  "desc": "You imbue your touch with the power to make a creature aloof, hardhearted, and unfeeling. The creature you touch as part of casting this spell must make a Wisdom saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw unless it’s currently charmed. On a successful save, this spell fails. On a failed save, the target becomes immune to being charmed for the duration; if it’s currently charmed, that effect ends. In addition, Charisma checks against the target are made with disadvantage for the spell’s duration.\n",
