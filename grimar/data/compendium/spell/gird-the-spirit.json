  "desc": "Your magic protects the target creature from the lifesapping energies of the undead. For the duration, the target has immunity to effects from undead creatures that reduce its ability scores, such as a shadow's Strength Drain, or its hit point maximum, such as a specter's Life Drain. This spell doesn't prevent damage from those attacks; it prevents only the reduction in ability score or hit point maximum.",
