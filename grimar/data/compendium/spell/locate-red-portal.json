  "desc": "For the duration, you can sense the presence of any dimensional portals within range and whether they are one-way or two-way. If you sense a portal using this spell, you can use your action to peer through the portal to determine its destination. You gain a glimpse of the area at the other end of the shadow road. If the destination is not somewhere you have previously visited, you can make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana, History or Nature-whichever is most relevant) check to determine to where and when the portal leads.",
