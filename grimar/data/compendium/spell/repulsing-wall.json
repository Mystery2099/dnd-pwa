  "desc": "You create a shimmering wall of light on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is translucent, and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to look through the wall.\n  One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 radiant damage when a creature enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature attempting to pass through the wall must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 10 feet away from the wall and falls prone. A creature that is undead, a fiend, or vulnerable to radiant damage has disadvantage on this saving throw. The other side of the wall deals no damage and doesn't restrict movement through it.",
