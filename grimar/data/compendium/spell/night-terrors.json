  "desc": "You amplify the fear that lurks in the heart of all creatures. Select a target point you can see within the spell’s range. Every creature within 20 feet of that point becomes frightened until the start of your next turn and must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures immune to being frightened are not affected by **night terrors**.",
