  "desc": "Deep Magic: Rothenian You summon a spectral herd of ponies to drag off a creature that you can see in range. The target must be no bigger than Large and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect. On a failed save, a spectral rope wraps around the target and pulls it 60 feet in a direction of your choosing as the herd races off. The ponies continue running in the chosen direction for the duration of the spell but will alter course to avoid impassable obstacles. Once you choose the direction, you cannot change it. The ponies ignore difficult terrain and are immune to damage. The target is prone and immobilized but can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell DC to escape the spectral bindings. The target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 20 feet it is dragged by the ponies. The herd moves 60 feet each round at the beginning of your turn.",
