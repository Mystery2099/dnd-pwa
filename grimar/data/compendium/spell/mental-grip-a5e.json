For the spell's duration, you can use an action to attempt to grapple a creature within range by making a concentration check against its maneuver DC.\n\nOn its turn, a target grappled in this way can use an action to attempt to escape the grapple, using your spell save DC instead of your maneuver DC.\n\nSuccessful escape attempts do not break your concentration on the spell.",
