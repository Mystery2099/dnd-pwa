  "desc": "The evil eye takes many forms. Any incident of bad luck can be blamed on it, especially if a character recently displayed arrogance or selfishness. When avert evil eye is cast, the recipient has a small degree of protection against the evil eye for up to 1 hour. While the spell lasts, the target of the spell has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, cursed, and frightened. During the spell's duration, the target can also cancel disadvantage on one d20 roll the target is about to make, but doing so ends the spell's effect.",
