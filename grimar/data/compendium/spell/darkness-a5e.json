  "desc": "Magical darkness heavily obscures darkvision and blocks nonmagical light in the area. The darkness spreads around corners. If any of the area overlaps with magical light created by a spell of 2nd-level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\n\nWhen cast on an object that is in your possession or unattended, the darkness emanates from it and moves with it. Completely covering the object with something that is not transparent blocks the darkness.",
