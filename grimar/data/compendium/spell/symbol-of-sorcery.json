  "desc": "You draw an arcane symbol on an object, wall, or other surface at least 5 feet wide. When a creature other than you approaches within 5 feet of the symbol, that act triggers an arcane explosion. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be stunned. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. After this symbol explodes or when the duration expires, its power is spent and the spell ends.",
