  "name": "Ley Surge",
  "desc": "You unleash the power of a ley line within 5 miles, releasing a spark that flares into a 30-foot sphere centered around a point within 150 feet of you. Each creature in the sphere takes 14d6 force damage and is stunned for 1 minute; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the stun. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. Special. A geomancer with a bound ley line can cast this spell as long as he or she is on the same plane as the bound line.",
