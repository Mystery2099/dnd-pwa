# Grimar

Self-hosted D&D 5e Progressive Web App built with SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5 Runes, Bun, and SQLite.

## Quick Start

This is a workspace project. Run all commands from the **project root** (parent directory):

```bash
# From project root (/path/to/dnd-pwa)
bun run dev              # Start dev server on localhost:5173
bun run build            # Build for production
bun run test:run         # Run tests
```

See the main [README.md](../README.md) in the project root for complete documentation.
